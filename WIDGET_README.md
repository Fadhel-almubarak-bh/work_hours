# Widget Functionality

The home screen widget provides a convenient way to clock in/out and view your overtime status without opening the app. The widget includes:

## Widget Pages

1. **Main page**: Displays your current clock-in/out status and has buttons to clock in or out.
2. **Overtime page**: Shows your monthly overtime statistics including expected vs. actual hours.
3. **Settings page**: Allows you to adjust the widget transparency directly from the widget.

## Widget Navigation

- Use the **left/right arrows** in the top-left corner to switch between the main and overtime pages.
- Tap the **settings icon** in the top-right corner to adjust the widget transparency.

## Transparency Settings

You can now adjust the widget transparency directly from the widget:

1. Tap the **settings icon** in the top-right corner of the widget.
2. Select one of the five transparency levels by tapping on it.
3. Tap **Save** to apply the changes and return to the widget's normal view.

This makes it easier to customize the widget appearance without leaving your home screen.

- **Streamlined user experience**: No need to open a separate activity
- **Real-time visual feedback**: See the transparency change immediately
- **Simplified interaction**: Everything is contained within the widget
